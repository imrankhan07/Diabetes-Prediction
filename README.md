# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes Mellitus is an increasingly prevalent chronic disease characterized by the bodyâ€™s inability to metabolize glucose. The objective of this prediction was to build an effective predictive model with high sensitivity and selectivity to better identify Canadian patients at risk of having Diabetes Mellitus based on patient demographic data and the laboratory results during their visits to medical facilities.
